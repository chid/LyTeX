"Endnote" "endnotes" "Adds an endnote inset, in addition to footnotes. You will need to add \theendnotes in TeX-code where you want the endnotes to appear." "endnotes.sty" "" "" ""
"Customisable Lists (enumitem)" "enumitem" "Control the layout of enumerate, itemize, description, and list/labeling with an optional argument. See http://mirror.ctan.org/macros/latex/contrib/enumitem/enumitem.pdf and example file shipped with LyX." "enumitem.sty" "" "" ""

"Fix cm" "fix-cm" "Fix-cm improves the appearance of Computer Modern fonts and makes them available with arbitrary sizes. For details see the documentation of the fix-cm.sty package: http://tug.org/texmf-dist/doc/latex/base/fixltx2e.pdf" "" "" "" ""
"Fix LaTeX" "fixltx2e" "Loads the LaTeX package fixltx2e which contains some bug fixes for LaTeX. Those fixes are not part of the LaTeX kernel because of backward compatibility. If you use this module your typeset document may look different when you process it with future LaTeX versions, because fixltx2e may provide more bugfixes in future versions." "" "" "" ""
